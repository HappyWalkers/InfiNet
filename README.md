# OverFusion
Implementation of DiffusionOverDiffusion architecture and training presented in NUWA-XL based on modified ModelScope text2video model for extremely long video generation

Plan:

0. Switch to PyTorch 2 for speed
1. Adapt the ModelScope code to NUWA-XL DiffusionOverDiffusion architecture
2. Add the training code https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion/blob/main/main.py and adapt it to DiffusionOverDiffusion training
3. Make test trainings and find the best hyperparams
4. ???
5. Profit
